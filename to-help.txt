  DESCRIPTION
    Change to your favorite and most visited directories quickly and easily. This project was
    created to help expedite moving between directories (via any bash enabled CLI).

  USAGE
    to [<tag> | <options>]
      'cd' into a directory that you want add to the route list and run the 'to --add' command.
      Once added, run 'to <tag>' to 'cd' into that directory from wherever you are. The 'tag'
      param closely matches the directory name you added to the route list (see normalization
      patterns below). To see all available routes, run the 'to --list' command.

      Example: cd path/to/myapp; to --add; cd ~; to myapp

  TAG NORMALIZATION
    Tag normalization happens when directory names have space, dash, and capital letters. Tags
    are always lowercase and spaceless words.

    Sample 1: directory name "myapp" is tagged as "myapp"
    Sample 2: directory name "My App" is tagged as "my_app"
    Sample 3: directory name "myApp" is tagged as "my_app"

  OPTIONS
    --add [<-v>]
      Adds your current working directory to the route list (with a tag matching your directory
      name). Use the optional '-v' parameter for a more verbose message.

    --rm [<-v>]
      Removes your current working directory from the route list (if it exists). Use the
      optional '-v' parameter for a more verbose message.

    --list [<-v>]
      Lists your available routes. Use the optional '-v' parameter for a more verbose message.

    --help
      Opens the help page.

    --version
      Outputs the version you're currently using.
